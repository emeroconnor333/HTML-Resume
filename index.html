    <h2>Work Experience</h2> 
    <ul>
        <li>Transition Year:
            <ul>
                <li><b>Matt Murphy’s Pharmacy:</b> I served customers on the till, stocked shelves, cleaned and helped customers by finding their prescription or a product from the shop floor.</li>
                <li><b>Labratories of Nutricia Factory</b> I saw how the powder and water were tested for bacteria and helped with cleaning and stocking the labs.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <br />
        <li><b>Volunteer at NCBI charity shop:</b> Every Saturday from July 2021 until February 2022 (8 months), I served at the till, dressed the mannequins for the window, hoovered, sanitised and sorted through donations to get them ready for the shop floor.</li>
        <br />
        <li><b>Green Store:</b> During transition year while I was in the Green Schools committee, I helped set up a non-profit called the Green Store with two other students. We selected eco-friendly products, bought them at wholesale prices and sold them to people in our school. We did this to make the school community aware of sustainable products and to make them easily accessible.</li>
        <br />
        <li><b>Irish Girl Guides member:</b> I have planned and led meetings with girls aged 5-7 years and 10-14 years. As part of a team, I organised and hosted activities such as arts and crafts, acting out stories and learning about nature. We decided what badges the girls needed to complete and before the meeting we organised suitable activities. Over lockdown when the meetings were online, I organised games, crafts and quizzes based on topics such as the environment. </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Accomplishments</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Highly Commended in the BT Young Scientist competition:</b> I entered the BT Young Scientist and Technology Competition with the project “Investigating What Ice Cube Is the Most Energy Efficient” and I won a highly commended award. My teammate and I spent five months preparing our project by researching the physics behind it, preparing and carrying out experiments and completing our project book. We had four online meetings with judges from UCD physics and maths departments who asked us questions about the project. Our project featured in the Corkman and Evening Echo newspapers.</li>
        <br />
        <li><b>The Gaisce Award:</b> This is also known as the President’s Award as it was set up by Michael D. Higgins. I completed the Bronze Gaisce Award in 2020 and the Silver Gaisce Award in 2023. We had three sections to commit to over the course of a year: community (green schools committee/ NCBI charity shop), physical (dance classes/ cycling) and personal skill (painting/ sewing).</li>
